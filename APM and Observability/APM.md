APM:
- performance
- reliability
- availability

APM relies on application traces and metrics

Four golden signals (according to "Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems" book):
- Errors - the rate of failed requests
- Latency - the time it takes to respond to a request
- Troughput - the number of requests received by a service
- Saturation - the utilization of an infrastructure's resources
