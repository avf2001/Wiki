# Memory Management
## Weak References
Weak references are a useful memory management technique, especially when implementing caching systems. A weak reference allows the garbage collector to collect an object while still providing a way to access it if it hasnâ€™t been collected.
```csharp
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();  
WeakReference<MyClass> weakReference = new WeakReference<MyClass>(myObject);
```
```csharp
MyClass target;  
if (weakReference.TryGetTarget(out target))  
{  
    // The object is still alive.  
    Console.WriteLine("Object has not been collected.");  
}  
else  
{  
    // The object has been collected.  
    Console.WriteLine("Object has been collected.");  
}
```
