# Caller Information
* CallerFilePathAttribute - Full path of the source file that contains the caller. The full path is the path at compile time.
* CallerLineNumberAttribute - Line number in the source file from which the method is called.
* CallerMemberNameAttribute - Method name or property name of the caller.
* CallerArgumentExpressionAttribute - String representation of the argument expression.

# Memory Management
## Weak References
Weak references are a useful memory management technique, especially when implementing caching systems. A weak reference allows the garbage collector to collect an object while still providing a way to access it if it hasnâ€™t been collected.
```csharp
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();  
WeakReference<MyClass> weakReference = new WeakReference<MyClass>(myObject);
```
```csharp
MyClass target;  
if (weakReference.TryGetTarget(out target))  
{  
    // The object is still alive.  
    Console.WriteLine("Object has not been collected.");  
}  
else  
{  
    // The object has been collected.  
    Console.WriteLine("Object has been collected.");  
}
```
## Avoid Large Objects
Creating large objects can cause performance issues, as they may trigger garbage collections more frequently. Instead, consider breaking down large objects into smaller ones or using data structures that allocate memory on-demand.

## Finalizers and Dispose Pattern
In some cases, you may need to implement a finalizer to ensure proper cleanup of unmanaged resources. However, finalizers can introduce performance overhead, so use them judiciously. Implementing the dispose pattern in conjunction with the IDisposable interface can help ensure that your objects are properly disposed of and that unmanaged resources are released in a timely manner.
