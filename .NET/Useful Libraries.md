# Logging
## SigNoz
SigNoz is an open-source observability tool that helps you monitor your applications and troubleshoot problems. It provides traces, metrics, and logs under a single pane of glass. It is available both as an open-source software and a cloud offering.

With SigNoz, you can do the following:
* Visualise Traces, Metrics, and Logs in a single pane of glass
* Monitor application metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints.
* Find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces.
* Run aggregates on trace data to get business-relevant metrics
* Filter and query logs, build dashboards and alerts based on attributes in logs
* Monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage
* Record exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript
* Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder
